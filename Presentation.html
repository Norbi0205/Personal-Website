    <h1>Presentation</h1>
    <p> I consider that my most important quality is ambition.
      I like to see every task completed and I don't give up regardless of the
      situation.
      Even as a child I had this way of thinking, I always aimed for
      bigger goals and I had to win. I can say that intrinsic motivation
      and this mindset played an essential role in my formation and
      thus I became the person I am now. I learned that you have to be
      fair, dignified, persistent and optimistic.
      Moreover , I am a punctual, focused, creative and organized
      person. I have successfully passed the challenges so far and I am
      willing to pass the next ones as well, because I see them as steps
      of initiation.
      I learn quickly and I like logical thinking, that is why I chose the
      Technical University of Cluj Napoca.
      My passions are programming, electronics and
      telecommunications and I would like to develop in these fields,
      because in my opinion they suit me best. Precisely for this
      reason, I enrolled in the mathematics-informatics high school
      and decided to pursue this field further, choosing the Faculty of
      Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology.</p>
